# Can You Understand "Real" English? Can You Speak It?

I started to learn to speak Spanish at home when I was a baby. My dad grew up in New Mexico and his family spoke both Spanish and English equally well.

My early learning stopped when my parents split up when I was 4\. Instead, I had to learn Spanish in high school from a textbook. I went to Mexico to stay for about a summer when I was 15\. Let me tell you: it was not like the Spanish I was learning at school.

I could hear expressions used very commonly by everyone, but I didn't have any idea what they meant. I couldn't understand why, if these expressions and words were so widely used, I hadn't learned them!

I realized that I _had_ learned words and ways of saying things that were _not_ like the native speakers. I had to throw away a lot and begin to listen and ask questions constantly. Everyone was so kind and patient with me; they explained what they were saying and taught me new words.

I have gone to site after site that claim to teach you the words most used by people (especially young adults), but they all skip over some of the most commonly used words because they are "bad words."
