Possible</h1><p>Hi! Permit me to introduce myself briefly. I am Lisa Trujillo. I was born and grew up in Washington State, USA. I have taught English and academic reading classes for over 16 years, most of that time as a tenured faculty member at Green River College, a two-year college near Seattle, Washington.</p><h2>Why You Should Listen to Her if You Are an International Student or Immigrant Student </h2><p>I chose to focus on teaching primarily pre-college level classes (numbered below 100 and non-transferable) for reasons I won't make you read here. What that meant in terms of my students was that my classes were composed of people representing a wide variety of backgrounds. They weren’t classified as ESOL (English Speakers of Other Languages) but they were almost always filled 50% minimum international students and immigrant students whose first language was not English.</p><h2>Is This Your Experience?</h2><p>Many of these students, as you may be fully aware, were paying high tuition rates as international students, and they were not earning transferable credits from taking my classes. These classes were prerequisite classes that needed to be completed successfully in order to reach college level classes that would count toward their degrees.</p><p>These students were unable to score high enough on the placement exam when they arrived to enroll in college level classes. In fact, many of the courses in every discipline (area of study, such as science or business) required students to be eligible for or to have already completed freshman (first year) English classes before they could enroll in those classes as well, thereby making it very difficult for these students to take any course that would apply toward their degree besides physical education or elective classes like art.</p><p>Paying living expenses, required health insurance, and tuition and books was very expensive, and spending extra quarters not progressing toward their degree was very disheartening to them, as well.</p><p>This situation is very common. </p><h2>How Lisa Can Help You Save Time and Money?</h2><p>If you are planning to study in the United States, or if you are already here and have experienced this for yourself, I can help you.</p><p>I can help you place higher on the assessment exam. If you have already started a sequence of pre-college level English and /or reading classes, I can help you make enough progress that you will be able to retake the assessment exam and score high enough to skip over the next level or levels and save yourself time and tuition money.</p><h2>Why Choose Lisa?</h2><p>I enjoy working with students from other countries, as I love to learn about their cultures and help them adjust to life in the United States— something they are often not adequately prepared for before they arrive, and they are met with a lot of surprises when things are more different than they realized.</p><p>Let me help you. Contact me and tell me what you would most like to learn from me and how I can best serve you!</p><picture>
